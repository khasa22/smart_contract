# smart_contract
Mini_smart contract application
Develop a smart-contract application in solidity using the IDE website https://remix.ethereum.org/
that allows:
- Initialize the main account 'msg.sender' with a number of N tokens.
- Initialize other accounts with 0 tokens.
- Send tokens between accounts on an event (purchase, shipping, delivery,
etc.). For example, if account A purchases a product from account B, then
a function of the smart-contract is executed to send the amount (which
corresponds to a number of tokens).
